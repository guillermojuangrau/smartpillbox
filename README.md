# Project Title

Smart pillbox concept completed as a final project for Telecommunications Engineering Degree

## Summary of the project

Conception, design and creation of a smart pillbox (physical parts, hardware and software) as well as production of a 3D printed open-source physical wireless prototype able to automatically sort and dispense pills to dependent polymedicated patients reducing medication errors and improving medical adherence.


### Contents of the project

Project is intended to be a prototype for a smart pillbox therefore in this project there will be several subcontents regarding hardware, software or electronics.
Below there is a list of the different contents included:
